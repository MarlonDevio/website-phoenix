      <h3>My Journey - From Ashes to Code</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Marlon. I am a 32-year-old self-taught developer with
        a story unlike any other. My journey through the trials of addiction and
        the depths of depression has shaped me into the person I am today – a
        testament to the power of resilience and rebirth. I am not just a
        developer; I am a phoenix rising from the ashes, continuously learning,
        evolving, and helping others along the way. My passion for technology is
        intertwined with my mission to inspire and aid those who have faced
        similar battles. Every project, every line of code, is a step towards a
        brighter future – not just for me, but for all who believe in the
        possibility of transformation."
